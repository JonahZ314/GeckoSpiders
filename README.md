<h2>interface Deque[E] </h2> Implemented in class QQ (Doubly-Linked Node Based)
  <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>addFirst(E x);</p>
    <p>addLast(E x);</p>
    <p>removeFirst();</p>
    <p>removeLast();</p>
    <p>peekFirst();</p>
    <p>peekLast();</p>

<h3>
Deque is implemented using doubly-linked nodes because the nodes have pointer to 
what is in front and behind, allowing us to implement the methods above in O(1) runtime.
